# Data and Models (Examples - adjust as needed)
# Large datasets or pre-trained models downloaded locally should generally not be committed.
# We are now tracking all 'results/' content.
# If specific subdirectories or files within 'results/' become too large later,
# you can add specific ignore rules for them here (e.g., results/large_temp_data/)
